# Tinder_chatBOT_based_on_ChatGPT3.5

I use ChatGPT'S API and Tinder's API to do it.

If you want to use this, you must follow the steps:

1. pip install tinderapi and the other packages
2. Modify the file c:\Users\\(Your username)\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python39\site-packages\tinderapi\tinder.py to the tinder.py in this repository.
3. Write your Tinder token and OpenAI token in the sendMessage.py
4. Just run it.
